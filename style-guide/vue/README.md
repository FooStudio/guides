# Vue

## Component

* Declare component name.
* Use `PascalCase` for naming components.

## Javascript

* Avoid having more than 150 lines of code (Excluding comments and line breaks) (Object literals and array declarations in multi-lines count as one).

## HTML

* Vue directives must precede HTML attributes.
* Props must go after HTML attributes.

## Vuex

## Ecosystem

* Use [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) as routing system.
* Use [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) as centralized app state management.
